# Slides Progress Bar

Simple script for Google Slides that allows you to generate a progress bar for your presentation with the appropriate slide numbering.

For a quick start, use the presentation template provided [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BekuEfiTjjCP0JFGTXruYB7WoQyIoQDNe_jGywfjDfY/edit?usp=sharing) and just follow the instructions there.


If you want to tinker with the settings yourself and start from scratch, follow these steps:
* Create a new Google Slides presentation or open an existing one
* Go to **Tools > Script editor**
* Copy the two files from the **script** folder into your Apps Script files and edit them as you see fit. I would suggest you use the name Configurable Progress Bar as a title for your Apps Script project.
* Go back to your slide and call your code by navigating to **Add-ons > Configurable Progress Bar > Open menu**
* Note: The first time you call code from an Apps Script file, Google will prompt you to grant permission - this is required for the script to execute.
