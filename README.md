# Slide Progress Bar / Automatic Slide Numbering
This repository contains two separate scripts for Google Slides.

# 1: Slide Progress Bar
Simple script for Google Slides that allows you to generate a progress bar for your presentation with the appropriate slide numbering. Features a menu bar, where you can edit settings without ever jumping back into the script file.
For a quick start, use the presentation template provided [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BekuEfiTjjCP0JFGTXruYB7WoQyIoQDNe_jGywfjDfY/edit?usp=sharing) and just follow the instructions.
# 2: Automatic Slide Numbering
Minimalistic script for Google Slides that allows you to generate an automatic page numbering. Deliberately simple and plain.
For a quick start, use the presentation template provided [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XJmMbUE9FiBFQlx0ez5-UYTGc0VlX3sNrjxFNL-CbC8/edit?usp=sharing) and just follow the instructions.


----------------

If you want to tinker with the settings yourself and start from scratch, follow these steps:
* Create a new Google Slides presentation or open an existing one
* Go to **Tools > Script editor**
* Copy the files from the **progress** (Slide Progress Bar) or **numbering** (Automatic Slide Numbering) folder into your Apps Script files. Pick a fitting title for your project, as that title will show up in the Add-on menu.
* Go back to your slide and call the functions by navigating to **Add-ons > [THE NAME YOU PICKED]**
* Note: The first time you call code from an Apps Script file, Google will prompt you to grant permission - this is required for the script to execute.
